        This is my WIP blog website.</h1>

    <h3>4/20/2022</h3>

    <p>Just a random start to my blog. While this is not my first time learning HTML, the computer science program here at RTC has gotten me more heavily invested into programming overall. I've learned some basics with Python, SQL, and C# so far. (Although at this time I couldn't call myself proficient in any of those.)</p>

    <p>I've never really written a blog before so I'll honestly just go about this in a free form, diary style info dump and keep it informal.</p>

    <p>As the titles says, this is a WIP and i'll be reorganizing and styling my blog as time progresses and I learn more. In the first two weeks i've already learned several different HTML tags from header to body, inlines, anchors, and so on.</p>

    <h3>4/20/2022</h3>

    <p>Shortly after getting this blog live, I started reviewing the materials taught in Tuesday's class and now know about style sheets. I've always been a fan of dark mode on every site, so you can bet my websites will be dark mode themed where I can apply it.</p>
